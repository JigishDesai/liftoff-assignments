## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a time tracking and invoicing application for IT service providers. Technicians will enter a ticket for each problem they resolve. The ticket will include the clients name, date and time worked, and description of the work. The client will get invoices depending on the type of client they are. The categories will be monthly, prepaid or hourly.
